# ustandard
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/bcomnes/ustandard/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bcomnes/ustandard/actions)

uStandard is a drop in replacement for [standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) that provides a cli that is a bundle generated by [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc). It reduces the number of transient dependencies in your node_modules by isolating all of these into a single js bundle.

Currently just an experiment.

```
npm install ustandard
```

## Usage

``` consle
npx ustandard
```

```console
npm i ustandard --save-dev
```

And then in your package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "standard"
  }
}

```
